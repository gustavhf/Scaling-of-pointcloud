# Scaling-of-pointcloud
This repository contains code and data for method of scaling a point cloud in an arbitrary coordinate system.

Additonal .LAS-files (not scaled and scaled) can be found by following this Google Drive URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pbe9wsPSvTpK9BXVPkbmHA01yhWdWvDJ?usp=sharing

To run the project:
1. Both Master and ransac must be downloaded with an additional point cloud .LAS-file.
2. In the code of the master at the bottom, put in which file is supposed to be scaled and what it shall be named after scaling. Fill in how many cylinders you want to detect and the ratio and radius of those cylinders.

Enjoy :)
